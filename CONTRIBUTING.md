## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- A GitHub account
- Basic understanding of command-line tools

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cloi.git
cd cloi
```

3. Set up the development environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Development branch
- Feature branches: `feature/your-feature-name`
- Bug fix branches: `fix/issue-description`
- Documentation branches: `docs/description`

### Making Changes
1. Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes following our coding standards
3. Write or update tests as needed
4. Run tests locally:
```bash
pytest
```

5. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature X"
```

### Commit Message Format
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Pull Request Process
1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the documentation if you're changing functionality
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer
4. Ensure all CI checks pass

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- Use Black for code formatting
- Use isort for import sorting
- Use flake8 for linting

### Documentation
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include examples in docstrings where appropriate
- Keep README.md and other documentation up to date
- Document all public APIs

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use pytest for testing
- Include both positive and negative test cases
