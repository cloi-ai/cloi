## Overview

Cloi is a local, context-aware agent designed to streamline your debugging process. Operating entirely on your machine, it ensures that your code and data remain private and secure. With your permission, Cloi can analyze errors and apply fixes directly to your codebase.

**Disclaimer:** Cloi is an experimental project under beta development. It may contain bugs, and we recommend reviewing all changes before accepting agentic suggestions. That said, help us improve Cloi by filing issues or submitting PRs, see down below for more info.
